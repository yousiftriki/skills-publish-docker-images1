_Congratulations, you've completed this exercise and learned how to publish packages to GitHub Container Registry!_

Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- **Set up GitHub Packages integration** with proper authentication and permissions using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Created a Docker publish workflow** that builds and publishes container images to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)
- **Enhanced your workflow** using official Docker actions including `docker/login-action`, `docker/build-push-action`, and `docker/setup-buildx-action`
- **Implemented dynamic tagging** with `docker/metadata-action` to automatically generate appropriate tags based on Git context (branches, pull requests, and releases)
- **Practiced a complete development lifecycle** by creating features, pull requests, and releases with proper container versioning

### What's next?

- Check out the other [GitHub Skills exercises](https://learn.github.com/skills).
  - Take the [Test with Actions](https://github.com/skills/test-with-actions) exercise to learn how to automate testing with GitHub Actions! Running automated tests before publishing packages is a good idea!
- See GitHub Docs for more on [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages) and [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
