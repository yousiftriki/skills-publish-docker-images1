  - Basic familiarity with containerization and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/)

- **How long**: This exercise takes less than 1 hour to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Set up a development environment and create a basic Docker workflow for building and publishing to GitHub Container Registry
1. Enhance the workflow with specialized Docker actions for improved performance
1. Implement dynamic tagging for automated versioning based on Git context
1. Practice a complete development lifecycle by creating features, pull requests, and releases with proper container versioning

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
